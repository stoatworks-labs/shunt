# Attributions

Shunt is built on other people's work. This file lists what that work is, who did
it, and what it is doing here.

It is generated — the master lists live in the `stoatworks-backend` repo and are
pushed out by `scripts/sync-attributions.py`. Edit it there, not here.

## Code we derived from other people's work

Someone else solved this first, and this project would not exist in its current form without their work.

### 2D signed distance functions — Inigo Quilez

<https://iquilezles.org/articles/distfunctions2d/>  
Licence: published derivations, used with credit

The shape primitives are the standard analytic forms derived and published by Quilez. The normalisation constants, the motion, and everything else in the plugin are ours — but the distance functions at the centre of it are his derivations and are used as published.

### Shape primitives — Stoatworks orrery

<https://github.com/stoatworks-labs/orrery>  
Licence: MIT  
Copyright: Stoatworks Labs

Same author, same fleet, but a copy rather than a shared library: the eight distance functions, their normalisation, the shading, the About block and the diagnostics log were written for orrery and carried over here. Named so that a reader of either repo knows which one the primitives are maintained in.

## Third-party code this project uses

Libraries, SDKs and frameworks the project is built on or bundles.

### Resolume FFGL SDK

<https://github.com/resolume/ffgl>  
Licence: BSD-3-Clause  
Copyright: FreeFrame

Vendored as a git submodule at external/ffgl (third_party/ffgl in oxbow).

The plugin ABI itself. An FFGL effect or source is defined by this SDK's headers — there is no other way to be loadable by Resolume Arena and Avenue.

### GLEW — the OpenGL Extension Wrangler Library

<https://github.com/nigels-com/glew>  
Licence: BSD-3-Clause (with Mesa 3-D and Khronos components)  
Copyright: Milan Ikits, Marcelo E. Magallon and Lev Povalahev

Arrives inside the FFGL submodule at external/ffgl/deps/glew-2.1.0. Not fetched separately.

Resolves OpenGL entry points on Windows, where the system headers stop at OpenGL 1.1.

### libpng

<http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html>  
Licence: PNG Reference Library License (libpng)  
Copyright: the PNG Reference Library authors

Arrives inside the FFGL submodule, under the SDK's CustomThumbnail sample.

Part of the upstream SDK tree rather than something these plugins call directly — listed because it is present in the checkout.

### stb_image

<https://github.com/nothings/stb>  
Licence: MIT or Public Domain (dual, at your option)  
Copyright: Sean Barrett

Single-header decoder vendored under external/stb/ and compiled into one translation unit.

Decodes PNG, JPEG and GIF. A sprite-sheet player has to open whatever the operator exported.

## Getting this wrong

If your work is here and the description is inaccurate, the licence is wrong, or you would rather not be listed — open an issue and it will be fixed.
