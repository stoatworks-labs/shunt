/**
    Logging for a plugin that lives inside somebody else's process.

    A small member of the fleet's `diag` family. The rest of the repos get a
    rotating log, a crash report and a diagnostics bundle; an FFGL plugin gets
    only the log, for two reasons:

    - **No crash handler.** A plugin loaded into Resolume must not install a
      process-wide signal handler. It would intercept faults that are not ours
      and interfere with the host's own handling. A plugin has no business
      deciding what happens when Resolume dies.
    - **No bundle command.** There is no UI to hang one off -- a plugin is a
      list of sliders in someone else's inspector.

    What it covers is the failures that actually happen, all of which look
    identical from the operator's side ("it does nothing") with no message
    anywhere:

    - **A shader would not compile**, so `InitGL` returns `FF_FAIL`. The GL
      vendor, renderer and version strings are logged next to the compile log,
      because a shader that builds on one machine and not on another is a driver
      answer, not a source answer.
    - **The instance uniform arrays would not resolve.** A shape plugin drawing
      nothing because `Xform` came back as location -1 looks exactly like a
      shape plugin whose shapes are all off-screen.
